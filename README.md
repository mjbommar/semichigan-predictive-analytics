This is the source repository for the S.E. Michigan Predictive Analytics Meetup group:  
http://www.meetup.com/Predictive-Analytics-S-E-Michigan/

The goal of this repository is two-fold:  
1. Store [kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com/) competition projects.  
2. Store source code related to talks, side projects, etc.
